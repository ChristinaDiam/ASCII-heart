## Cute ASCII he(art) code

This is a simple code in C++ i wrote on my first year in university.  
I wanted to try anything close to painting/drawing and combine it with my studies, since painting is my passion.

Now I dedicate this piece of code to the person who inspired me and helped me not to give up even in the most difficult times.
